# Web Scraping to check if an item is in stock
Script to check if a specific item (playstation 5) in web stores is in stock or not in Cyprus.
To find playstation 5 in now days is very difficult.
So I created a bot to check every 50 sec stock inventory of many online stores.
When a ps5 is in stock the program sends notifications to any device using push over application.
